# Employee Database
Utilized Data Engineering and Data Analysis to build a SQL database of employees of a corporation called Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s. There are six CSV files holding the data of employees. The SQL tables were designed and the data in the CSVs were successfully imported into a SQL database.

# Data Engineering
* Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables.

* Used the information from ERD to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files and specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

* Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table and make sure to import the data in the same order that the tables were created

# Data Analysis
* List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

* List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

* List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

* List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

* List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

* List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

* List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

* List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
