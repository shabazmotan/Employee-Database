# Employee Database

# Goal
Utilize Data Engineering and Data Analysis to build a SQL database of employees of a corporation called Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s. There are six CSV files holding the data of employees. The SQL tables were designed and the data in the CSVs were successfully imported into a SQL database.

# Data Engineering
* Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables.

* Used the information from ERD to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files and specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

* Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table and make sure to import the data in the same order that the tables were created
